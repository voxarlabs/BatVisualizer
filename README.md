# **Bat Visualizer**

### Synopsis
This project is a web tool that uses the [DÂ³](https://d3js.org/) and [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) libraries to allow the visualization of data obtained from the *SiRAC*. This project was developed at [Voxar Labs](http://cin.ufpe.br/~voxarlabs/).

### Run

If you want to run it by yourself you can download the repository and run the python command:
```
Python 2.7
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
Python 3.6
    python -m http.server 8000
```
> You can change the *8000* parameter to any desired port

### Data
